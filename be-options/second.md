# 📝 Assignment: Blog Post with Commenting System

Expected time investment: 6 - 8 Hours

Preferred languages/frameworks: Node.js & React or Next.js 

## 📘 Overview

In this assignment, you'll build a simple **blog platform** where users can **read posts** and **leave comments**. The focus is on building a clean, functional web app that demonstrates how to manage structured content and user input safely and effectively.

This assignment emphasizes **CRUD operations**, **frontend-backend integration**, and **user-generated content handling**.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Design a basic blogging platform with post creation and display
- Implement a **commenting system** under each post
- Handle user input safely and validate data
- Demonstrate clear separation of concerns in web app architecture

---

## 🧠 Core Concepts to Explore

- **RESTful APIs** for managing blog posts and comments
- **Client-server communication** using fetch/AJAX
- **HTML sanitization** and prevention of XSS
- **Frontend rendering** (e.g., templating or SPA)
- **Database schemas** for posts and comments

---

## 📌 Requirements
